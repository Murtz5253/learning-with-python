# User Stories

## User 1: Carolyn, Student learning CS independently
This student will want to select topics to learn, look through their learning progress and receive an analysis report, and select specific problems for practice. Carolyn is not expected to be super technically skilled and will have an interface that does not require code or terminal commands.

## User 2: Nikolay, Student Learning CS in Class
Nikolay will want to do everything that the above user does, but additionally view feedback and grades from the teacher, as well as submit work directly to the teacher. Nikolay is similarly not expected to interact with the program using code or terminal commands.

## User 3: Yilin, Teacher Using This to Teach CS
Yilin will want to evaluate student progress, view their solutions/submitted work, provide feedback to students, and select topics/problems which will be used for their curriculum. The teacher is expected to have some more knowledge, and it might be helpful to give the teacher the ability to interact with the program at a lower level of abstraction to add/remove problems.
